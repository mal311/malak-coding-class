        I study in <i>Avenzoar </i>. It's a school in Temara, Morocco.<br>
        In this school,there iskindergarten, elementary, middle, and hight school. 
        It's a normal school where we study subjects such as <i>science, maths, french, arabic, english...</i>

         and finish them at <b>3.30pm</b>
        while he starts at <b>8.30 am </b>and finishes at <b>4.30 pm</b>
